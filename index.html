        <h2>Who is Ian?</h1>
        <p>I am a 21 years old computer science student from Mexico City. From an early age, I started playing with my father gadgets and my love for tecnology began from then. In further years, I discovered that tecnology is more than just computers, the core it self it is, but is not the only thing to consider. Any improvement in anything that already exists is tecnology and from that statement I began researching more about it.</p>

        <li>IoT Website/Database/Simulator- June 2020</li>
        <p>This project's goal was to design a website that showed different measurements regarding weather
        conditions in Mexico City, such as temperature, humidity and Co2. The purpuse of this website
        was to take note of how bad our weather conditions actually are. For this project my team and I worked with matlab, as well as  packet tracker and php myadmin for the data base.<p/>
